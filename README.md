# Java_DataStructure_Algorithm_UI-2019
A repository to show some of the data structures and algorithms I have written in java over time.
It consists of some games, packages, classes, interfaces... 
I focused on writting algorithms using java API and building some of mine along the way.
Majority of this was done 2019.
